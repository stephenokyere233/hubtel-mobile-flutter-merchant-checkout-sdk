# Hubtel Merchant Checkout SDK - Flutter

The Hubtel Flutter Checkout Package is a convenient and easy-to-use library that simplifies the process of implementing
a checkout flow in your Flutter application.

## Installation

The `Hubtel Merchat Checkout` package is available on GitHub for Flutter apps to integrate with their apps. It'll be available
on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) soon.

### github.com

1. Open your `pubspec.yaml` file.
2. Add the following lines to your dependencies section:

```yaml
  hubtel_merchant_checkout_sdk:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/hubtel/hubtel-mobile-flutter-merchant-checkout-sdk.git
      ref: main
```

## Getting Started

_Objects needed_
| Properties | Explanation |
|--|--|
|**`HubtelCheckoutConfiguration`**|is an object used for payment processing with Hubtel Checkout service. It enables merchants to set their identification, specify a callback URL for payment notifications, and secure transations with a merchant API key.|
| **`merchantId`** (required)|given to the merchant to use the sdk. This is one of three parameters to be passed to the `configuration` object.|
| **`merchantApiKey`** (required)|Base64 encoded string of the customer’s id and password. Also passed to be passed to the `configuration` object.|
| **`callbackUrl`** (required)| A url provided by the merchant in order to be able to listen for callbacks from the payment api to know the status of payments. Also passed to the `configuration object`.|
|**`PurchaseInfo`**|Information about the purchase to process. Details are given below.|
| **`amount`** (required) | The price of the item or service the customer is trying to purchase from.|
| **`customerPhoneNumber`** (required) | A required mobile number of the customer purchasing the item.|
| **`purchaseDescription`** (required)| An optional description attached to the purchase.|
| **`ThemeConfig`**|Lets you pass a `primaryColor` that the checkout adopts.|

## Integration

1. Add the package to your app as described above.
2. Import the package in the screen you want to implement the checkout like so:
```dart
import 'package:hubtel_merchant_checkout_sdk/hubtel_merchant_checkout_sdk.dart';
```
3. Create a `HubtelCheckoutConfiguration` object, like so:

```dart

final hubtelConfig = HubtelCheckoutConfiguration(
  merchantApiKey: "QTN1akQ1SzpiM2IxMjA1NTEwZmI0NjYzYTdiY2ZmZmUyNmQ1YmIzZA==",
  merchantID: "1122334",
  callbackUrl: "www.sdfasd.com",
  routeName: "/",
);
```

4. Create a `PurchaseInfo` object, like so:

```dart

final purchaseInfo = PurchaseInfo(
  amount: 0.1,
  customerPhoneNumber: '0541234567',
  clientReference: const Uuid().v4(),
  purchaseDescription: 'Camera',
);
```

Note that `Uuid().v4()` is agnostic of this package, it's given by the uuid package available on `pub.dev`.

5. You may optionally create a `ThemeConfig` object like so:

```dart

final themeConfig = ThemeConfig(primaryColor: Colors.black);
```

6. On your pay button, for example, having all necessary configurations set, navigate to the `CheckoutScreen` like so:

```dart@
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(
    builder: (context) {
      return CheckoutScreen(
        purchaseInfo: purchaseInfo,
        configuration: hubtelConfig,
        onCheckoutComplete: (status) => {},
        themeConfig: themeConfig,
      );
    },
  ),
);
```

### PaymentStatus Cases

The `PaymentStatus` is an enum displaying the status of payment. It contains the following cases:

- `userCancelledPayment`: When the user closes the checkout page without performing any transaction.
- `paymentFailed`: When the user performs a transaction but payment fails.
- `paymentSuccessful`: When the user finally pays successfully.
- `unknown`: When the user cancels transaction after payment attempt without checking status.
